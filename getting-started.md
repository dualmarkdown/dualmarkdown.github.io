## Getting started

We are currently preparing a set of examples that illustrate how to create Dual Markdown documents and how to automatically generate a variety of output documents (PDF, docx, HTML, EPUB, etc.) from them by using [Panbuild](https://github.com/jcsaezal/panbuild/blob/master/README.md) and the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor.
